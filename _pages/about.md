# About
I am a Ph.D. student in the [EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).
My research interests include machine learning systems, large language models, compilers, and distributed systems.
I received my B.S. degree in computer science from ACM Honors Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I was a research intern at Amazon Web Services, OctoML, and University of Washington.
I am fortunate to be awarded the [Meta PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/fellows/zheng-lianmin/).
