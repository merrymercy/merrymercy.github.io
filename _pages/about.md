# About
I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the [EECS department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/) and [Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/).
My research interests include machine learning systems, large language models, compilers, and distributed systems.
I received my B.S. degree in computer science from ACM Honors Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
I was a research intern at Amazon Web Services, OctoML, and University of Washington.
I am fortunate to be awarded the [Meta PhD Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/fellows/zheng-lianmin/) and [a16z Open Source AI Grant](https://a16z.com/announcing-our-latest-open-source-ai-grants/).

Currently, I am leading the [LMSYS.org](https://lmsys.org/) effort to advance open large language models.
