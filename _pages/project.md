# [Alpa](https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa)
Alpa automates model-parallel training of large deep learning (DL) models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism.

# [TVM](https://tvm.ai)
TVM is an open deep learning compiler stack for cpu, gpu and specialized accelerators.  
I lead the effort to generate high-performance programs with machine learning techniques.
Check out the tutorials on [template-based autotvm](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/index.html#autotvm-template-based-auto-tuning)
and [template-free auto-scheduler (a.k.a Ansor)](https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/index.html#autoscheduler-template-free-auto-scheduling).

# [Compiler Malic](https://github.com/merrymercy/compiler2017)
Malic is the winner compiler (1/25) in Compiler 2017 at ACM Class.  
It compiles a java-like language to x86-64 asm with basic optmization techniques.

# [WSC & FVM](https://github.com/merrymercy/WSC-and-FVM)
WSC is a C-minus compiler runs on the Casio fx-9860 graphing calculator.  
FVM is a virtual machine to provide the runtime for the bytecode generated by WSC.  
With WSC & FVM, you can compile C-minus programs direcly on a Casio fx-9860 calculator.
